Here we'll quickly create a small graph representing a subset of motorcycle riders and teams taking part in the MotoGP league. Once created, we'll start querying our data.

```
$ docker exec -it 14eb bash
root@14eb75e19d2b:/data# redis-cli
```

```
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> GRAPH.QUERY MotoGP "CREATE (:Rider {name:'Valentino Rossi'})-[:rides]->(:Team {name:'Yamaha'}), (:Rider {name:'Dani Pedrosa'})-[:rides]->(:Team {name:'Honda'}), (:Rider {name:'Andrea Dovizioso'})-[:rides]->(:Team {name:'Ducati'})"
```

```
1) 1) Labels added: 2
   2) Nodes created: 6
   3) Properties set: 6
   4) Relationships created: 3
   5) "Query internal execution time: 0.399000 milliseconds"
 ```
 
 Now that our MotoGP graph is created, we can start asking questions. For example: Who's riding for team Yamaha?
 
 ```
 127.0.0.1:6379> GRAPH.QUERY MotoGP "MATCH (r:Rider)-[:rides]->(t:Team) WHERE t.name = 'Yamaha' RETURN r.name, t.name"
1) 1) "r.name"
   2) "t.name"
2) 1) 1) "Valentino Rossi"
      2) "Yamaha"
3) 1) "Query internal execution time: 0.625399 milliseconds"
```

How many riders represent team Ducati?

```
127.0.0.1:6379> GRAPH.QUERY MotoGP "MATCH (r:Rider)-[:rides]->(t:Team {name:'Ducati'}) RETURN count(r)"
```

```
1) 1) "count(r)"
2) 1) 1) (integer) 1
3) 1) "Query internal execution time: 0.624435 milliseconds"
```

- Labels/ Relationship Types
- Properties

## Node 
Simply a reference to Redis Hash

A Node called "Linus Torvald" pointing to Redis Hash which has some properties like shown below;


Linus Torvald ================>.  Linus Torvald {
                                   First_Name: Linus 
                                   Age: "59"
                                   }
 
# Relations


Once we have node, we would like to connect them,

Linus. =============. VISIT. =====================.  Finland

# How to store Graph in Redis?

With the help of Hexastore

```
Subject.   Predicate            Object
     S           P                  0
```

     
We store all 6 permutation of the relationship

```
