# Redis Enterprise Modules

Redis Labs developed and certified these modules for use with Redis Enterprise Software (RS):

## RedisBloom
Enables RS to have a scalable bloom filter as a data type. Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures that do a very good job at quickly determining if something is contained within a set.

## RedisGraph
RedisGraph is the first queryable Property Graph database to use sparse matrices to represent the adjacency matrix in graphs and linear algebra to query the graph. RedisGraph uses Cypher as its query language.


## RedisJSON
Now you have the convenience JSON as a built-in data type and easily able to address nested data via a path.


## RediSearch
This module turns RS into a supercharged distributed in-memory full-text indexing and search beast.
